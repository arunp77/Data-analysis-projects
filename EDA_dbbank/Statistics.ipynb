    "    The rolling mean is a common technique to smooth out fluctuations and identify trends in the data. By averaging out the noise and short-term fluctuations in the data, the rolling mean can help highlight longer-term patterns and trends.

    "5. **Moving average convergence divergence (MACD):** \n",
    "\n",
    "    MACD stands for Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD, or MAC-D) , which is a technical indicator used in finance to analyze stock price trends and momentum. \n",
    "    It is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of a security’s price. The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA. The result is plotted on a graph, and a 9-day EMA of the MACD is also plotted as a \"Signal Line\".\n",
    "\n",
    "    The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called the signal line, which is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals. Traders may buy the security when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and sell—or short—the security when the MACD line crosses below the signal line. MACD indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The formula to calculate the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `MACD Line = 12-day Exponential Moving Average (EMA) of Closing Prices - 26-day EMA of Closing Prices`\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Signal Line = 9-day EMA of MACD Line\n",
    "    - MACD Histogram = MACD Line - Signal Line\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this formula, the MACD Line is calculated by subtracting the 26-day EMA of the closing prices from the 12-day EMA of the closing prices. The Signal Line is then calculated by taking the 9-day EMA of the MACD Line. Finally, the MACD Histogram is calculated by subtracting the Signal Line from the MACD Line.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Key features:**\n",
    "    1. MACD is best used with daily periods, where the traditional settings of 26/12/9 days is the norm.\n",
    "    2. MACD triggers technical signals when the MACD line crosses above the signal line (to buy) or falls below it (to sell).\n",
    "    3. MACD can help gauge whether a security is overbought or oversold, alerting traders to the strength of a directional move, and warning of a potential price reversal.\n",
    "    4. MACD can also alert investors to bullish/bearish divergences (e.g., when a new high in price is not confirmed by a new high in MACD, and vice versa), suggesting a potential failure and reversal.\n",
    "    5. After a signal line crossover, it is recommended to wait for three or four days to confirm that it is not a false move.\n",

    "    (Blue: MACD, Red: Signal)\n",
    "\n",
    "    MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the chart above) that graphs the distance between MACD and its signal line. If MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline, or zero line. If MACD is below its signal line, the histogram will be below the MACD’s baseline. Traders use the MACD’s histogram to identify when bullish or bearish momentum is high—and possibly overbought/oversold.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Relative Strength (RSI) index | MACD |\n",
    "|-------------------------------|------|\n",
    "| The relative strength index (RSI) aims to signal whether a market is considered to be overbought or oversold in relation to recent price levels. The RSI is an oscillator that calculates average price gains and losses over a given period of time. The default time period is 14 periods with values bounded from 0 to 100. A reading above 70 suggests an overbought condition, while a reading below 30 is considered oversold, with both potentially signaling a top is forming, or vice versa (a bottom is forming). | The MACD lines, however, do not have concrete overbought/oversold levels like the RSI and other oscillator studies. Rather, they function on a relative basis. That’s to say an investor or trader should focus on the level and direction of the MACD/signal lines compared with preceding price movements in the security at hand, as shown below. |\n",

In a bullish market, investors may be buying more stocks, and there is generally more demand than supply for shares, which drives the prices higher.\n",

    "    Momentum monitors the change in prices. It tells you whether prices are increasing at an increasing rate or decreasing at a decreasing rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Is the market trend about to change? \n",
    "    - Is the market overbought or oversold? \n",
    "\n",
    "    Momentum may help us to find those market conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    **Formula:** Momentum is calculated using a simple formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "    `Momentum = Current Price - Price n periods ago`\n",
    "\n",
    "    Where `n` represents the number of periods, which could be days, weeks, or months, depending on the timeframe being analyzed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Momentum can be calculated by computing the continuous difference between prices at fixed intervals. That difference is either a positive or negative value. \n",
    "    - When momentum is above the zero line and rising, prices are increasing at an increasing rate. \n",
    "    - If momentum is above the zero line but is declining, prices are still increasing but at a decreasing rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The opposite is true when momentum falls below the zero line. \n",
    "    - If momentum is falling and is below the zero line, prices are decreasing at an increasing rate. \n",
    "    - With momentum below the zero line and rising, prices are still declining but at a decreasing rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Traders use momentum to identify potential trend reversals, as well as to confirm the strength of an existing trend. When momentum is positive and rising, it suggests that the price is likely to continue to increase. Conversely, when momentum is negative and falling, it suggests that the price is likely to continue to decrease.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Momentum can also be used in conjunction with other technical indicators, such as moving averages, to generate buy and sell signals. For example, a trader may look for a crossover of the moving average and momentum lines as a signal to enter or exit a position.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It's important to note that momentum is just one tool among many used in technical analysis and should not be relied upon solely to make trading decisions. It's essential to consider other factors, such as fundamental analysis, market conditions, and risk management, before making any investment decisions.\n",

    "9. **Stochastic (STO):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Stochastic (STO) is a popular technical indicator used by traders to identify potential trend reversals and overbought or oversold conditions in the market. It measures the relationship between a security's closing price and its price range over a specified period, typically 14 days.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Stochastic oscillator consists of two lines: \n",
    "    - the `%K` line and \n",
    "    - the `%D` line. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The `%K` line represents the current price's position relative to the highest and lowest prices over a specified period, while the `%D` line is a moving average of the `%K` line.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The mathematical formulas to calculate the Stochastic oscillator are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $\\%K = \\frac{C- L14}{H14-L14}\\times 100$\n",
    "\n",
    "    where\n",
    "\n",
    "    - C = The most recent closing price\n",
    "    - L14 = The lowest price traded of the 14 previous trading sessions\n",
    "    - H14 = The highest price traded during the same 14-day period\n",
    "    - %K = The current value of the stochastic indicator\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    $\\%D = 3~\\text{-day SMA of}~ \\%K$\n",
    "\n",
    "    Where:\n",
    "    - `3-day SMA`: the simple moving average of the %K line over the past three periods\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Notably, %K is referred to sometimes as the fast stochastic indicator. The \"slow\" stochastic indicator is taken as %D = 3-period moving average of %K. \n",
    "\n",
    "    >  **3-day SMA:** A 3-day SMA is a simple moving average that is calculated by adding up the closing prices of an asset over the past three trading days and dividing the sum by three.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The resulting values for `%K` and `%D` will range from 0 to 100, with higher values indicating overbought conditions and lower values indicating oversold conditions. Typically, when the %K line crosses above the `%D` line, it is considered a bullish signal, while a bearish signal is generated when the `%K` line crosses below the `%D` line.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Traders may also use the Stochastic oscillator in conjunction with other technical indicators, such as trendlines or moving averages, to confirm potential signals or filter out false ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "    It's important to note that no single technical indicator can provide perfect trading signals, and traders should always consider multiple factors, including fundamental analysis, market conditions, and risk management, before making any trading decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "| RSI | STO |\n",
    "|-----|-----|\n",
    "| The RSI is a momentum oscillator that measures the magnitude of recent price changes to evaluate whether a stock is overbought or oversold. The RSI compares the average gains of the stock's price during a given period (usually 14 days) to the average losses during the same period. The RSI is expressed as a value between 0 and 100, and a reading above 70 is typically considered overbought, while a reading below 30 is typically considered oversold. | The STO, on the other hand, is a momentum indicator that compares a stock's closing price to its price range over a given period. The STO consists of two lines, %K and %D, which are both expressed as values between 0 and 100. The %K line measures the current price in relation to the highest and lowest prices over a given period, while the %D line is a moving average of the %K line. When the %K line crosses above the %D line, it is seen as a bullish signal, indicating that the stock may be about to rise, and vice versa. |\n",

    "### Multiple datasets and compartive study\n",
    "If you have data for three more companies with the same data structure as the Deutsche Bank share data, there are many things you can do with pandas and other Python libraries. Here are some ideas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Merge the data:** You can use pandas to merge the data for all four companies into a single DataFrame, allowing you to analyze and compare the data more easily. For example, to merge the Deutsche Bank, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon data into a single DataFrame:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    # read in the data for all four companies\n",
    "    db = pd.read_csv('deutsche_bank.csv')\n",
    "    apple = pd.read_csv('apple.csv')\n",
    "    microsoft = pd.read_csv('microsoft.csv')\n",
    "    amazon = pd.read_csv('amazon.csv')\n",
    "    # merge the data for all four companies on the 'Date' column\n",
    "    merged_data = pd.merge(db, apple, on='Date', suffixes=('_db', '_apple'))\n",

    "    merged_data = pd.merge(merged_data, amazon, on='Date', suffixes=('_db', '_amzn'))\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "2. **Visualize the data:** You can use matplotlib or seaborn to create visualizations of the data for each company and compare them. For example, to plot the closing price of each company over time:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    # plot the closing price for each company over time\n",
    "    plt.plot(db['Date'], db['Close'], label='Deutsche Bank')\n",
    "    plt.plot(apple['Date'], apple['Close'], label='Apple')\n",

    "    plt.plot(amazon['Date'], amazon['Close'], label='Amazon')\n",
    "    plt.title('Closing Price Over Time')\n",
    "    plt.xlabel('Date')\n",
    "    plt.ylabel('Closing Price')\n",
    "    plt.legend()\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Calculate summary statistics:** You can use pandas to calculate summary statistics for each company, such as the mean, standard deviation, and correlation coefficient. For example, to calculate the mean closing price and volume for each company:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    # calculate mean closing price and volume for each company\n",
    "    mean_close = merged_data[['Close_db', 'Close_apple', 'Close_msft', 'Close_amzn']].mean()\n",
